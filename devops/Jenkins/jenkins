Jenkins

Continuous integration phases:
=-----------------------------
->repository: monitoring the repository if any new commit is called poll scm
->Integrate : Integrate the change
->Build: 
	compile,test,package,deploy, code average, code analysis
	
--------------------------------

Jenkins flexibility:
->jenkins is a highly confiugurable system by itself
->The additional community developed plugins provide even more flexibility
->by Combaining jenkins with ant, gradle  or other build automatin tools, the possibilities are limitless

->acts as a cron server replacement
-------------------------------

Jenkins tasks:
Job-Task

*Global system configuration
-tools
-environment variables	
*Node configuration:
*Plugin configuration
*Job Configuration-tasks
	-Where to run (label)
