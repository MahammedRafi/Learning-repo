Jenkins

Continuous integration phases:
=-----------------------------
->repository: monitoring the repository if any new commit is called poll scm
->Integrate : Integrate the change
->Build: 
	compile,test,package,deploy, code average, code analysis

Jenkins flexibility:
->jenkins is a highly confiugurable system by itself
->The additional community developed plugins provide even more flexibility
->by Combaining jenkins with ant, gradle  or other build automatin tools, the possibilities are limitless

->acts as a cron server replacement
